# Yellow-Pages-Scrapper
Scarps yellowpages.com and stores data in csv file.


# Getting Started

For this web scraper using Python 3, we will need some packages for downloading and parsing the HTML. 
Below are the package requirements:

Python Requests, to make requests and download the HTML content of the pages (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/install/)

Python LXML, for parsing the HTML Tree Structure using Xpaths ( http://lxml.de/installation.html)

# Running the scraper
We would execute the code with the script name followed by the positional arguments **keyword** and **place**. Here is an example
to find the business details for tutors in Atlanta. GA.

# Example
python3 yellow_pages.py tutors Atlanta,GA


#Output
This will create a csv file
